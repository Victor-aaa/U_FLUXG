                                this bit is to control what is output at the
                                VOUT pin when the on-chip DAC is connected to
                                VOUT. This bit should be set to 0 if the
                                control bit OPBITEN = 1. This is explained
                                further in Table 15. When mode = 1, the SIN ROM
                                is bypassed, resulting in a triangle output
                                from the DAC. When mode = 0,the SIN ROM is used
                                to convert the phase information into amplitude
                                information, which results in a sinusoidal
                                signal at the output.
     12    000008              DIV2__CTRL    = 0x0008  // DIV2 is used in

                                explained further in Table 15. When DIV2 = 1,
                                the MSB of the DAC data is passed directly to
                                the VOUT pin. When DIV2 = 0, the MSB/2 of the
                                DAC data is output at the VOUT pin. 
     13    000020              OPBITEN__CTRL = 0x0020  // The function of this
                                bit, in association with D1 (mode), is to
                                control what is output at the VOUT pin. This is
                                explained further in Table 15. When OPBITEN =
                                1, the output of the DAC is no longer available
                                at the VOUT pin. Instead, the MSB (or MSB/2) of
                                the DAC data is connected to the VOUT pin. This
                                is useful as a coarse clock source. The DIV2
                                bit controls whether it is the MSB or MSB/2
                                that is output. When OPBITEN = 0, the DAC is
                                connected to VOUT. The mode bit determines
                                whether it is a sinusoidal or a ramp output
                                that is available. 
     14    000040              SLEEP1__CTRL  = 0x0040  // When SLEEP1 = 1, the
                                internal MCLK clock is disabled, and the DAC
                                output remains at its present value because the
                                NCO is no longer accumulating. When SLEEP1 = 0,
                                MCLK is enabled. This function is explained
                                further in Table 14.
     15    000080              SLEEP12__CTRL = 0x0080  // SLEEP12 = 1 powers
                                down the on-chip DAC. This is useful when the
                                AD9833 is used to output the MSB of the DAC
                                data.SLEEP12 = 0 implies that the DAC is
                                active. This function is explained further in
                                Table 14.
